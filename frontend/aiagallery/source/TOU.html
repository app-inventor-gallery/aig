<h2>MIT App Inventor Gallery Terms of Use</h2>

<h3>MIT Center for Mobile Learning</h3>

<p>
Welcome to MIT’s Center for Mobile Learning’s App Inventor Gallery website (the “Site”).
You must read and agree to these Terms of Service and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> (collectively,
the “Terms”) prior to using any portion of this Site. These Terms are an agreement between you
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. If you do not understand or do not agree to be
bound by these Terms, please immediately exit this Site.
<p>
MIT reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time and will publish notice of any such
modifications online on this page for a reasonable period of time following such modifications,
and by changing the effective date of these Terms. By continuing to access the Site after notice
of such changes have been posted, you signify your agreement to be bound by them. Be sure

<h4>Description of MIT App Inventor Gallery Site</h4>

You can access MIT App Inventor software, which lets you develop applications for Android
devices using a web browser and either a connected phone or emulator,
at the <a href="http://www.appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a> website. This
Site allows you to upload your own projects and to access projects uploaded by others. As part
of this community, you are sharing projects with and commenting on projects developed by
people from many different cultures and countries, of many different ages, with all levels of
experience. Please be respectful.

<h4>Account Required for Use of MIT App Inventor</h4>

In order to log in to the Site, you need to use a Google account. Your use of that account is
subject to <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/">Google’s Terms of Service</a>
for accounts, and the information you provide to Google is governed by
<a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
MIT has no access to your Google account or the
information you provide for it other than the account email address, which we may use to
contact you. In the future, the Center for Mobile Learning may provide alternative means for
using this Site without Google accounts, at which point we will update these terms of use to
reflect those alternatives.

<p>
By submitting or distributing your User Postings, you affirm, represent, and warrant that you

<h4>Community Guidelines</h4>

<h4>Do’s</h4>

We need your help to make this community a supportive place for every member. Here is how
you can help:

<ul>
  <li>
  Be respectful. When sharing projects or posting comments, remember that people of
  many different ages and backgrounds will see your contributions.
  <li>
  Offer constructive comments. Rather than criticize a project or forum post, say what you
  like about it and offer suggestions on how to make it better.
  <li>
  Give credit. Feel free to make modified versions of other people’s projects – just make
  sure to give them credit.
  <li>
  Help keep the site friendly. If you feel that others would find a project or comment mean,
  insulting or otherwise inappropriate, click the link that says “flag as inappropriate.” The
  MIT App Inventor Gallery team will review, and may remove any project, comment, or
  post.
</ul>
